# ReactJS Base Template

This project is a work-in-progress (WIP) ReactJS base template designed to minimize the need for third-party libraries. It aims to provide a solid foundation for building React applications with custom-built components and functionality.

## Current State

The project is under active development and is not yet ready for production use. It includes several core components and features that are being refined and expanded.

## Key Components

1. **BaseComponent**: A foundational component that serves as the basis for other UI components, providing consistent styling options and theme integration.

2. **Container**: A versatile component used for wrapping and styling sections of the application.

3. **Button**: A customizable button component with support for different states.

4. **InputField**: A styled input field component for user input.

5. **Card**: A component for displaying grouped content with consistent styling.

6. **Sidebar**: A collapsible panel for navigation links.

7. **NavBar**: A navigation bar component for the header section.

8. **ErrorBoundary**: A component for handling and displaying errors gracefully.

## Features

- Responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Theme support (light and dark modes)
- Dynamic form generation
- PDF display capabilities
- State management using Redux

## How to Use

As this is a WIP, the usage instructions are subject to change. However, you can start by cloning the repository and installing the dependencies:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <project-directory>
npm install
```

To run the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

## Project Structure

The project follows a standard React application structure:

```
src/
  components/
  handlers/
  slices/
  App.js
  index.js
  store.js
```

## Current Limitations

- Some components may not be fully implemented or tested
- Documentation is limited and evolving
- Third-party dependencies may still be present but are being minimized

## Contributing

As this is a personal project in development, contributions are not currently being accepted. However, feedback and suggestions are welcome.

## License

This project is private and does not have a specific license at this time.

## Future Plans

- Complete implementation of all base components
- Improve documentation and usage examples
- Implement comprehensive testing
- Optimize performance and bundle size
- Create a demo application showcasing all components

Please note that this project is in active development, and significant changes may occur as it progresses.
